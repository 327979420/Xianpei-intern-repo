# 🏆 Milestone: Stakeholder Management & Communication

## 🎯 Managing Stakeholder Expectations as a Scrum Master

## 🔍 Research & Learn

### ❓ Who are key stakeholders in Agile projects, and what are their expectations?  
Key stakeholders usually include the Product Owner, end users, business managers, clients, and sometimes technical leads or compliance teams. Their expectations typically revolve around frequent delivery of working features, clear visibility into progress, responsiveness to feedback, and alignment with business goals. They expect the team to deliver value incrementally, adapt quickly to change, and communicate status honestly and regularly.

### ❓ How do Scrum Masters help negotiate scope changes while keeping sprints on track?  
Scrum Masters work closely with the Product Owner to evaluate the urgency and impact of proposed scope changes. If the change is critical, they help the team assess which existing tasks can be removed or deferred to maintain a realistic workload. If not urgent, the Scrum Master encourages adding the new request to the backlog for future prioritization. Their goal is to protect the sprint goal while staying flexible and responsive to stakeholder needs.

### ❓ What techniques help ensure stakeholder transparency without overwhelming the team?  
Techniques include maintaining a clear, up-to-date task board (e.g., GitHub Projects), using simple dashboards or burndown charts for progress reporting, and holding structured sprint reviews. Stakeholder communication is time-boxed and focused on value, not technical details.

The Scrum Master acts as a filter—sharing relevant updates with stakeholders while shielding the team from excessive interruptions.

### ❓ How can Agile teams balance business urgency with sustainable development pace?  
Agile teams balance urgency and pace by setting realistic sprint goals based on capacity and maintaining a sustainable work rhythm. They use prioritization techniques, like MoSCoW or weighted scoring, to focus on what delivers the most value first. The Scrum Master ensures that urgent items are triaged and do not cause burnout by adjusting scope rather than increasing workload. Continuous feedback loops and retrospectives help the team stay aligned and improve pace without sacrificing quality.

## 📝 Reflection

### ❓ If a stakeholder demands a last-minute change mid-sprint, how should a Scrum Master respond?  
If a stakeholder at Focus Bear demands a last-minute change mid-sprint, the Scrum Master should first evaluate the urgency and impact of the request in collaboration with the Product Owner and development team.

If the change is critical—such as fixing a bug that affects user onboarding or data accuracy—it may justify adjusting the sprint scope, possibly by removing or deferring lower-priority items. However, if the change is not urgent, the Scrum Master should guide the stakeholder to add it to the product backlog for future prioritization, preserving the team’s current sprint focus.

Throughout this process, the Scrum Master ensures clear communication, protects the sprint goal, and helps the team avoid context-switching fatigue while still being responsive to business needs.

### ❓ How can a Scrum Master communicate delays or roadblocks without causing frustration?  
A Scrum Master can communicate delays or roadblocks effectively by focusing on transparency, solutions, and team impact rather than just the problem itself. During standups or sprint check-ins, they can explain the reason for the delay (e.g., waiting on design input, unexpected bug, or intern availability) and immediately follow up with what’s being done to resolve it.

For example, if backend testing is delayed due to unclear requirements, the Scrum Master can mention that a clarifying session with the PM and QA is scheduled. Framing the update as part of an ongoing improvement effort, and inviting collaboration where needed, helps maintain trust and avoids blame—turning roadblocks into opportunities for team learning and adjustment.

### ❓ What strategies help prevent unrealistic stakeholder expectations from derailing sprints?  
One key strategy is setting a well-defined sprint goal that all stakeholders agree on, so they understand what the team is committed to delivering. During sprint reviews and check-ins, the Scrum Master and PM can reiterate team capacity, especially considering interns' limited availability, to ground expectations in reality.

Any new requests are added to the product backlog for future prioritization, not directly into the active sprint, unless truly critical. By maintaining this structure and consistently explaining the “why” behind planning decisions, the team builds stakeholder trust without overcommitting or derailing sprint focus.

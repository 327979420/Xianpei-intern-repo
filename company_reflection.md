# Thoughts on Focus Bear and Personal Experience

1. **Understanding Distractibility:**  
   People who struggle with distractibility often know what is beneficial for them but find it difficult to maintain good habits. I believe this app is designed to help individuals with ADHD symptoms minimize distractions, stay focused, and maintain healthy routines.

2. **Focus Bearâ€™s Purpose:**  
   Focus Bear primarily targets distraction (focus mode) and aims to help users develop consistent routines through pop-ups and reminders.

3. **The Need for Support Tools:**  
   After watching Jeremy's interview on YouTube from a year ago, I learned that individuals with ADHD and autism symptoms experience higher rates of job dismissal and unemployment, leading to the loss of many valuable talents. Focus Bear serves as a helpful tool to keep them on track and motivate them in a positive way.

4. **Personal Connection to Focus Bear:**  
   I am a psychology graduate, and my interest in social, behavioral, and psychological topics began in childhood. I have noticed some ADHD symptoms in myself, such as getting easily distracted, struggling to focus for long periods, and experiencing fluctuations in creativity and productivity. I have been practicing meditation inconsistently for three years but have maintained a daily routine for the past four months. Additionally, I already follow a structured workout plan and incorporate meditation when necessary. Given this, I strongly resonate with what Focus Bear aims to achieve. Like every Focus Bear team member, I deeply value focus, productivity, and inner peace.

5. **Challenges of Focus in the Modern World:**  
   Yes, I believe maintaining focus has become increasingly difficult with the rise of smartphone use and short-form video content. Unfortunately, these two are highly addictive, and I have personally struggled with them since high school. Recognizing these tendencies early, I have taken steps to mitigate their impact by engaging in weightlifting, participating in sports, watching full-length movies instead of short anime episodes, and practicing meditation.

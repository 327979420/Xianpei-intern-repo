# Reflection  

## 1. What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?  

As a Manual QA Tester, my primary responsibility is to ensure that the software functions correctly before it reaches users. I test new features, identify bugs, verify functionality, and ensure that everything meets the specified requirements.  

In the Agile process, I contribute by:  
- Testing new features as they are developed.  
- Finding and reporting bugs to improve software quality.  
- Ensuring that each sprint delivers a working and stable product.  

## 2. How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?  

I collaborate closely with various team members:  

- Developers – I test their code, report issues, and retest fixes to ensure stability.  
- Product owners – I clarify requirements to ensure that testing aligns with user expectations.  
- Scrum master – I provide updates on testing progress and highlight blockers that could impact the sprint.  
- Automation QAs – I help define which test cases should be automated to improve efficiency.  
- UI/UX designers – I verify that the user interface functions as intended and matches the design specifications.  

# Task  

## 1. Write a short description of how your role fits into the Agile team.  

For example, if our developers build a content-sharing feature, I test it manually and identify bugs. If I find that content cannot be shared to TikTok on Mac, I report the issue to the developers. Once they fix the problem, I retest it to confirm that everything works as expected.  

## 2. Identify one other role you frequently collaborate with and describe how you can improve teamwork with them.  

I frequently collaborate with developers. To improve teamwork, I will:  

- Talk to developers before testing starts to better understand the feature and anticipate potential issues.  
- Use clear bug reports with step-by-step instructions, screenshots, and expected versus actual results for better clarity.  
- Participate in stand-up meetings to discuss progress and blockers daily, avoiding last-minute issues and improving overall sprint efficiency.

# üèÜ Milestone: Measuring & Improving Agile Processes

## üõ†Ô∏è Task (Hands-On Project)

### ‚ùì Explore GitHub Projects and identify available tracking features.

After setting up the internal GitHub tool, I explored the Focus Bear GitHub Project but have not yet found any usable resources or tracking data to work with. As an alternative, I collected onboarding progress data from four interns and used this information to create a **Burndown Chart** in **Jira** (on 03/11).  

For this exercise, I set up a **4-week sprint**. The expectation is that the Backend Team will complete the onboarding process ahead of schedule, with the larger deadline set around April.  

#### Burndown Chart Progress (Remaining Work ‚Äì Actual Line: Orange)  
- On **February 24**, we started with **10 story points**.  
- By **March 8**, we had reduced the remaining work to **6 points**, after completing **Milestones 1‚Äì3**.  
- As of **March 11**, we remained at **6 points**, since work on the remaining milestones was still in progress.  
- After **March 11**, all interns began working on **Milestone 4**, with two of them expecting to finish all remaining milestones before **March 19**.

### ‚ùì Look at how issues progress through the workflow and note any trends.

Currently, we are experiencing a minor bottleneck. Some of the interns have just started working on **Milestone 4**, which represents the halfway point of the milestone plan. As the complexity of tasks increases, there is a higher risk of work piling up closer to the sprint deadline.  

The current trend suggests a slowdown in task completion, which highlights the need for closer progress monitoring and additional support to maintain steady momentum through the second half of the sprint.

### ‚ùì Write a short summary of findings, including whether this tool could be useful for Focus Bear.

While I am still becoming familiar with GitHub Projects, I found setting up a Burndown Chart within the tool to be quite time-consuming. If we decide to use this tool regularly, it would be helpful to develop a simple setup guide or manual for future project managers to reference. This would streamline the onboarding process for new users and reduce setup time.

Despite the learning curve, the Burndown Chart offers valuable real-time visibility into project progress. It helps rotating team members quickly understand how the team is tracking against sprint goals, making it easier to identify delays or potential blockers. I also found it useful during daily standups, as it provides a clear snapshot of where we stand and allows me to remind the team about upcoming deadlines and remaining work.

Although I have not yet fully mastered the tool, it is clear that GitHub Projects works best when used within a structured process. To maximize its effectiveness, the team should maintain one project board per sprint, use milestones to organize user stories, and create issues for all backlog items. 

Overall, the clarity and structure offered by GitHub Projects and its associated tools help reduce confusion, particularly for new interns who are rotating in and out of the team. This improved transparency ensures that everyone stays aligned with the team‚Äôs goals and fosters more efficient collaboration.

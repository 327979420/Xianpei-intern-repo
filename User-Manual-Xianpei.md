1. **Need from Teammates:**  
   If I am working in an unfamiliar area (such as front-end development or manual testing, which are new to me), I prefer receiving detailed instructions from my teammates. This approach minimizes failure risks and allows me to complete the work efficiently and with high quality, without repeatedly asking for confirmation. In general, I appreciate direct communication from my teammates, as it is the most efficient way to collaborate and ensure alignment.  

2. **Communication Preference:**  
   I am open to any communication method as long as it is reasonable and effective, based on the importance and urgency of the situation. For critical tasks or must-do events, I prefer having proper documentation to track updates, responsibilities, and progress, ensuring accountability and clarity for all involved.  

3. **Ways to Stay Focused:**  
   When I feel slightly fatigued, listening to music helps me stay productive. Additionally, I am a to-do list person—I like to plan my days, schedule tasks, and stick to my plan until completion. I thrive in an interactive workplace where collaboration is valued because I believe communication is essential to productivity and teamwork.  

4. **Feedback:**  
   I have no specific preference for how feedback is delivered. I value personal growth and team development, and as long as feedback is constructive, reasonable, and beneficial for both the individual and the company, I am happy to receiving and implementing it.  

5. **Work Style:**  
   I am a research-oriented person who enjoys deepening my understanding through self-study. However, I also highly value feedback and recommendations from others, as I have learned a lot from my previous mentors and supervisors. I consider myself both a good student and a good teacher—I am always willing to assist my teammates when needed. My teammates turned to me for support when they needed an extra hand, such as when a coworker is on vacation or unavailable.

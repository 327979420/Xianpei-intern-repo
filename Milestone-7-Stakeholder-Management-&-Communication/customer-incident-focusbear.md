# 🏆 Milestone: Stakeholder Management & Communication

## 🚨 Handling Customer Complaints & Incidents That Disrupt Sprints

## 🔍 Research & Learn

### ❓ What types of customer complaints or incidents commonly disrupt sprints?  
Urgent bug reports, service outages, performance issues, and security vulnerabilities are common customer-related incidents that can disrupt sprints.

### ❓ How do Agile teams handle urgent bug fixes vs. planned sprint work?  
Agile teams typically reserve a portion of sprint capacity—often called a buffer—for handling unexpected critical issues. Urgent bugs are triaged quickly, and if they meet the threshold for disruption, they may be added to the sprint with team consensus. Less critical items are added to the product backlog for future prioritization.

### ❓ What strategies help balance customer responsiveness with maintaining sprint focus?  
Teams use triage meetings or on-call rotations to handle customer issues without constantly interrupting the sprint. Setting clear rules for what qualifies as an emergency helps maintain sprint stability. Communication with stakeholders ensures transparency when planned work is impacted by high-priority customer needs.

### ❓ How can Scrum Masters work with PMs, Developers, and QAs to prioritize urgent issues?  
Scrum Masters facilitate quick syncs with the PM, Developers, and QA to assess the severity and business impact of the issue. They help the team decide whether the item should be handled immediately or deferred without compromising the sprint goal. Clear criteria and mutual understanding among roles help make decisions quickly and effectively.

## 📝 Reflection

### ❓ If a customer reports a critical bug that must be fixed immediately, how should it be handled?  
The first step is to triage the issue with the Product Manager (if applicable), backend developers, and Jeremy to confirm its impact and urgency—especially if it affects core features like onboarding or focus tracking.

The Scrum Master (or project manager) would then facilitate a quick sync, adjust the sprint scope if needed, and clearly document the change in GitHub Projects. While this disrupts planned work, it's important to maintain clear communication with the team and stakeholders to explain the shift in priority. After the fix, we’d reflect on the incident in the retrospective to consider whether a better process (like sprint buffer time or alert triaging) could prevent future disruption.

### ❓ What are the risks of constantly interrupting sprint work for customer issues?  
First, it disrupts the team’s focus and momentum, making it harder for developers—especially interns with limited working days—to complete planned tasks within the sprint. Over time, this can cause a decline in velocity and reliability, making it difficult to predict delivery timelines. 

It may also demoralize the team if they feel their efforts are frequently derailed, especially when context-switching between planned work and emergency fixes. Without proper boundaries or a triage process, it becomes harder to maintain a healthy balance between being responsive to users and delivering long-term improvements.

### ❓ How can Scrum Masters help teams avoid context switching fatigue while still addressing urgent issues?  
The Scrum Master can help the team avoid context switching fatigue by creating a structured process for handling urgent issues without overwhelming developers. One approach is to designate a “support rotation” where one team member (e.g., a backend intern like Arief or Pratik) is on-call during the sprint to handle unexpected tasks, allowing others to stay focused on sprint goals. 

The Scrum Master can also ensure that urgent requests are triaged quickly with the PM, so only truly critical issues interrupt ongoing work. For less urgent problems, they can be logged in GitHub and scheduled for future sprints. Additionally, by reviewing interruptions during retrospectives, the team can reflect on how emergencies are affecting focus and adjust sprint planning or buffer time accordingly. This balance helps maintain team energy while still keeping customer needs in view.

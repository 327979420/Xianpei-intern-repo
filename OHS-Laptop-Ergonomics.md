# Workspace Ergonomics and Healthy Habits

1. What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup?  
Connecting to an external monitor and iPad helps separate screens and reduces head-down phone use. Using a laptop stand is beneficial for neck and spine alignment, while an external mouse helps reduce wrist strain. Ensuring the chair is properly adjusted and using an ergonomic keyboard can also enhance comfort and prevent strain.  

2. What behavioral changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain?  
Maintaining an open chest posture and positioning myself in a way that allows for the most efficient breathing—maximizing air intake with minimal effort—helps with both posture and overall well-being. Additionally, sitting upright, keeping feet flat on the floor, and adjusting the screen to eye level help reduce strain on the neck and back.  

3. How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day?  
Focus Bear will remind me to take a break every 40 minutes. During these breaks, I may take a short walk, stretch, or hydrate if time allows. Setting additional reminders or using a posture-correcting device can also reinforce good habits throughout the day.

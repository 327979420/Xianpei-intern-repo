# 🏆 Milestone: Stakeholder Management & Communication

## 🧪 Working with QAs to Improve Testing & Release Cycles

## 🔍 Research & Learn

### ❓ How do Scrum teams integrate QA into sprints to avoid last-minute testing?  
Scrum teams involve QA from the beginning of the sprint by including them in planning, backlog refinement, and daily standups. Test cases and acceptance criteria are defined early to ensure alignment with development work. Developers and QAs work closely throughout the sprint, with testing performed incrementally as features are completed. This approach ensures continuous feedback and reduces the risk of testing being rushed at the end.

### ❓ What are best practices for collaboration between Developers and QAs?  
Clear communication and early involvement are key—QAs should participate in sprint planning and story discussions. Developers can share builds or partial features early for testing, allowing QAs to begin their work before final implementation. Pairing or close coordination during bug fixing helps ensure issues are fully resolved. Shared tools and transparent status tracking (e.g., through GitHub Projects) also improve coordination.

### ❓ What are common reasons for delayed releases due to QA bottlenecks, and how can they be prevented?  
⚠️ Delayed releases often happen when testing is left until the end, or when test environments and resources aren’t ready on time. Lack of clear acceptance criteria and frequent last-minute changes also contribute to delays.

✅ To prevent this, teams can:

🧪 Integrate testing into the sprint – Involve QA early, not just at the end. This ensures issues are caught sooner and quality is built in from the start.  
📋 Create well-defined test plans and acceptance criteria – Clear expectations help both developers and testers stay aligned and reduce ambiguity.  
🧱 Prioritize test cases – Focus on high-impact or high-risk areas first to make the most of limited testing time.  
🤖 Automate regression tests – This speeds up repeatable testing and frees up QA for exploratory testing and edge cases.  
🖥️ Maintain stable test environments – Reliable environments reduce setup delays and help teams test more efficiently throughout the sprint.

### ❓ How can Scrum Masters help prioritize and communicate critical bugs that must be fixed before release?  
Scrum Masters facilitate quick triage discussions with the team to assess the impact and urgency of critical bugs. They ensure that the Product Owner and stakeholders are informed and that the team understands which issues block the release. Bugs that must be fixed are clearly flagged in the task board and prioritized over non-critical tasks. The Scrum Master also helps coordinate efforts between developers and QAs to resolve blockers efficiently and keep release timelines visible.

## 📝 Reflection

### ❓ If QAs report a critical bug near the end of a sprint, how should it be handled?  
If QAs at Focus Bear report a critical bug near the end of a sprint—such as a backend issue affecting login or focus tracking—the team needs to quickly assess the impact and urgency of the bug.

The first step is a triage discussion between the QA, developer (like Arief or Pratik), and PM to determine whether the bug is a release blocker or can be deferred. If it's critical, the Scrum Master or PM may help re-prioritize the remaining sprint tasks, possibly dropping a lower-priority item to make room for the fix. This adjustment should be clearly reflected in GitHub Projects, with updated task status and comments for visibility.

After resolving the bug, the team can reflect during the retrospective on how to improve early testing or communication to avoid last-minute surprises in future sprints.

### ❓ How can teams ensure that testing is not rushed or skipped due to tight deadlines?  
At Focus Bear, ensuring that testing isn’t rushed or skipped requires early QA involvement and a realistic understanding of the team’s capacity, especially given the part-time nature of many team members. One effective practice is to involve QAs in daily standups and encourage weekly co-working sessions, fostering real-time communication and quicker feedback loops.

Testing activities are planned alongside development tasks in GitHub Projects, making them a core part of the sprint rather than an afterthought. Features are only considered “done” once they meet defined testing standards, promoting shared ownership between developers and QAs. To further support this, internal deadlines are set mid-sprint for development completion, allowing sufficient time for QA to review and validate changes before the sprint ends—reducing the risk of last-minute testing and maintaining product quality.

### ❓ What strategies help reduce friction between Developers and QAs during bug triage?  
Reducing friction between Developers and QAs during bug triage starts with creating a shared understanding of severity and priorities. One strategy is to define clear criteria for what counts as a critical, major, or minor bug—so both QAs and developers are aligned during triage discussions.

Using GitHub issue templates helps ensure that QAs provide enough context, steps to reproduce, and screenshots, which saves developers time and prevents misunderstandings.

Regular coworking sessions and standups also help both sides clarify blockers early, resolve disputes quickly, and build mutual respect. Most importantly, the team emphasizes that fixing bugs isn’t about assigning blame, but about improving product quality together.

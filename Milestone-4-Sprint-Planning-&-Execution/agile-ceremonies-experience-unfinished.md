### ❓ How do effective Scrum Masters adapt facilitation styles based on team needs?  
Effective Scrum Masters assess team maturity and adjust their approach accordingly. For a new team, they provide more structure and direct guidance, such as setting clear expectations in standups. With experienced teams, they adopt a coaching style, allowing members to take more ownership. They also adapt communication styles, balancing structured discussions with flexibility to keep meetings engaging and productive.

### ❓ How can a Scrum Master encourage engagement and participation in meetings?  
A Scrum Master sets a positive environment by ensuring meetings have a clear purpose and encouraging diverse participation. I consider using interactive formats like round-robin discussions or anonymous feedback in retrospectives to help quieter team members share their thoughts. Moreover, it's good to rotate discussion leaders to keep engagement high and ensure all voices are heard.

## 📝 Reflection

### ❓ What techniques can help ensure standups remain short and focused?  
At Focus Bear, standups tend to run long when updates become overly detailed, especially as interns explain new tasks they’re learning. To stay within 15 minutes, we’ve found it helpful to gently remind everyone to focus on high-level progress and blockers, rather than diving into solutions.

Updating the GitHub Projects board before the meeting gives the team visual context, reducing the need for long explanations. As many team members work different days, async updates in Discord the night before can also help make standups more concise. Finally, maintaining a consistent structure—even if Jeremy or Deon leads—helps everyone stay aligned and on time.

### ❓ How can you keep retrospectives productive while ensuring honest feedback?  
Retrospectives often include interns who are new to Agile and may be hesitant to speak openly. Using anonymous feedback forms in Google Sheets before the meeting helps surface concerns they might not voice aloud.

During the retrospective, we make space for everyone to reflect, often starting with lighter prompts (e.g., “What made you smile this sprint?”) to create a comfortable atmosphere. It’s also important to show progress on past action items, like when Jeremy shared updates on the onboarding guide improvements after it came up as a pain point. This shows the team that their feedback is valued and acted upon, encouraging more honest contributions in the future.

### ❓ If a developer or QA frequently misses standups, how should you handle it?  
We’ve had cases where team members, especially interns balancing coursework, occasionally miss standups. The first step is to check in privately and ask if the standup time works for them or if they feel unclear about its purpose.

If Jeremy is unavailable, they typically provide an async update via GitHub or Slack, which keeps the team informed without disrupting workflow. We also encourage interns to block standup time in their Google Calendar, reinforcing its priority.

If absences persist and affect team coordination, we loop in a mentor or team lead to explore adjustments in workload or scheduling, ensuring we balance team needs with individual circumstances.

## 🛠️ Task

### ❓ Write a reflection on your experience running ceremonies, noting any challenges or improvements made.  
Running Agile ceremonies at Focus Bear during the early stages of my internship has been both a rewarding and eye-opening experience.One aspect that worked particularly well was the overall engagement and willingness to collaborate. Having a structured format—centered around the three standup questions and clear retrospective prompts—helped maintain clarity and kept discussions focused. I also appreciated how supportive the team was in assisting with logistics for in-person meetings, such as helping me reserve meeting rooms at their university campuses since I didn’t have direct access to those spaces. This teamwork really reinforced a collaborative spirit.

However, one of the biggest challenges has been inconsistent in-person participation. While we aim for at least one in-person session per week, the changing locations and days, along with the fact that team members are spread across Melbourne (Unimelb, Swinburne, Monash), make it difficult to gather the entire team in one place consistently. This often leads to uneven attendance, impacting the effectiveness of face-to-face discussions and team bonding. Additionally, the fluctuating weekly regimen makes it hard for everyone to plan ahead and commit to being physically present.

To address these challenges, we plan to maintain hybrid participation, ensuring that remote team members can join via Google Meet, even during in-person sessions. I’ve also encouraged team members to confirm their availability in advance using the Google Sheet attendance record, which helps with finalizing meeting dates and choosing locations that work best for those available.For those unable to attend in person, we’ve established async follow-ups using Fathom's notetaking. These rituals have helped us maintain continuity and inclusivity, even when the team can’t physically be together.This experience has highlighted the importance of flexibility, proactive communication, and logistical planning when running Agile ceremonies in a diverse and geographically dispersed team like we have at Focus Bear. I’ve learned that small process improvements can make a significant difference in keeping everyone engaged and aligned.

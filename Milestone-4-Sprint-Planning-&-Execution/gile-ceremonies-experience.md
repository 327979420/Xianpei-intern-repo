## 📝 Reflection

❓ What techniques can help ensure standups remain short and focused?  
- ⏳ Limit each standup to 15 minutes to maintain efficiency.
- 🎯 Three Key Questions like what Focus Bear Slides propose. Keep discussions focused on What did you do yesterday?, What will you do today?, and Any blockers?
- 📌 Use task boards or dashboards to quickly align the team on progress.
- 👏 Remind team members to keep updates concise and relevant.
- 🚶‍♂️ Conduct meetings while standing to naturally encourage brevity.

❓ How can you keep retrospectives productive while ensuring honest feedback?  
- Use anonymous feedback tools (e.g., Miro, Retrium) to encourage openness.  
- Ensure action items are tracked and revisited in the next retrospective.  
- Show that feedback leads to real improvements, increasing team trust.  

❓ If a developer or QA frequently misses standups, how should you handle it?  
- Check in privately to understand the reason—time conflict? Lack of perceived value?
- Set clear expectations on participation.  
- Suggest async updates if needed.  
- Escalate if necessary, especially if it impacts collaboration.

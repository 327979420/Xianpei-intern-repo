# Reflection Questions

1. **First Impressions:**  
   My first impression of this app is that it is user-friendly. It feels easy to use because of its attractive theme colors and cartoon-style design. The interface is clean, so I expected a strong core function rather than a series of complex features. I soon realized that it is also a smart, user-guided app, offering plenty of customization options and settings to enhance its effectiveness based on user preferences.

2. **Navigation Experience:**  
   Based on my personal habits, it took me some time to navigate the Mac version of Focus Bear, especially when trying to find my account information and settings (I initially didn't realize these were under "Preferences"). Typically, settings are located at the top of the toolbar or near the "Close Window" button. For a productivity app like Focus Bear, I believe the main function—starting a focus session—should be more prominent and visually dominant in the interface. However, this setup did encourage me to explore the app more as a new user.

3. **App Purpose:**  
   Focus Bear is an produtivity and efficiency app designed to help users stay focused and minimize distractions.

4. **Suggestions for Improvement:**  
   Fewer pop-ups and only a final reminder would improve the experience for me. As a new user, I am more interested in fully engaging with the main focus mode without interruptions and I usually begin to explore other side functions after.

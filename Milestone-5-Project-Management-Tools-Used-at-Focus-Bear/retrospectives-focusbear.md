# 🏆 Milestone: Familiarity with Project Management Tools

## 🔍 Research & Learn 

### ❓ What is the purpose of a Sprint Retrospective, and how does it benefit Agile teams?  
The purpose of a Sprint Retrospective is to reflect on the previous sprint and identify areas for improvement. It gives the team an opportunity to discuss what went well, what didn’t go well, and agree on actionable changes for the next sprint. This continuous reflection helps Agile teams improve collaboration, efficiency, and product quality over time by fostering a culture of learning and adaptation.

### ❓ How does Focus Bear document retrospectives in Google Docs?  
At Focus Bear, retrospectives are documented in Google Docs using a structured format that includes sections like “What went well,” “What didn’t go well,” and “What could be improved.” Team members add their reflections under each section, often during or after the meeting, ensuring transparency and shared understanding. Action items are noted, but follow-up tracking can vary between retrospectives.

### ❓ What are the key elements of an effective retrospective summary?  
✅ **What Went Well** – Highlights successes, positive outcomes, and practices the team should continue.  
⚠️ **What Didn’t Go Well** – Identifies challenges, blockers, or areas where the team struggled.  
📝 **Action Items** – Lists specific, measurable improvements with owners and deadlines for accountability.  
🗳️ **Decisions Made** – Captures agreements or process changes decided during the retrospective.  
🔄 **Follow-up on Previous Actions** – Reviews progress on action items from the previous retrospective to ensure continuous improvement.

### ❓ How can Scrum Masters ensure that retrospective action items are followed up on?  
Scrum Masters can ensure action items are followed up on by making them visible and trackable. This often involves adding them to the team’s GitHub Project board or Jira backlog with clear owners and deadlines. Reviewing these items regularly during daily standups or sprint planning keeps them top of mind. Additionally, including a follow-up review in the next retrospective reinforces accountability and ensures continuous improvement.

## 📝 Reflection

### ❓ What challenges can arise in keeping retrospective notes actionable?  
One common challenge is vague action items. For example, writing "improve communication" without clear steps or assigned responsibility makes follow-up difficult. To avoid this, I will ensure that each action item includes specific descriptions, clear owners, and measurable outcomes.

Another challenge is capturing too many action items at once, which can overwhelm the team and reduce focus. Regularly reviewing and prioritizing these actions is essential to ensure they lead to meaningful improvements rather than being overlooked.

Having an efficient standup schedule and preparing discussion topics in advance for meetings will help maintain focus and productivity.

### ❓ How can documenting retrospectives help in identifying long-term trends?  
Documenting retrospectives creates a record of what went well and what didn’t across multiple sprints. Reviewing these notes regularly helps identify long-term patterns. For example, if slow code reviews are mentioned repeatedly, it highlights an ongoing issue that requires deeper investigation. By maintaining and reviewing these records, I can track whether past improvements were successful and make better-informed decisions about where to focus future efforts.

### ❓ What steps can be taken to ensure that team feedback from retrospectives leads to real improvements?  
It’s essential to translate feedback into clear, actionable tasks. For example, setting a goal like "reduce pull request review time to under 24 hours" is far more effective than a vague statement like "communicate better." I will make sure the team focuses on specific, measurable goals rather than general suggestions.

Limiting the number of action items in each sprint helps avoid overwhelming the team and increases the chance of successfully implementing meaningful changes.

Regularly reviewing these action items in future retrospectives is crucial. Cinmily mentioned that retrospectives were typically held every Thursday in the past. Once we begin working on real projects, I will plan ahead and collaborate with other project managers to ensure high-quality retrospectives.

Easy Agile emphasizes tracking action items on the team’s backlog or project board and reviewing progress in daily standups or retrospectives. This maintains accountability and fosters continuous improvement.

## 🛠️ Task

### ❓ Write a short reflection on how retrospectives are documented and used at Focus Bear.  
After reviewing past retrospective documents in Google Docs at Focus Bear, several common themes and patterns have emerged.

One consistent theme is the challenge with onboarding and knowledge sharing, particularly due to the high turnover of interns and varying experience levels across the team. Many retrospectives mention the need for clearer documentation and better onboarding guides. This aligns with feedback about team members struggling to get up to speed on backend processes or tools like GitHub Projects and Posthog.

Another recurring pattern is difficulty in time estimation and task scoping, often resulting in unfinished tasks or last-minute rushes. Several retrospectives suggest improvements in sprint planning, including more collaborative estimation techniques and breaking large tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces.

There is evidence that some action items have been followed up on, such as the creation of updated onboarding guides by Jeremy and Cinmily, and the introduction of more structured GitHub boards. However, not all action items show clear follow-up. For example, there are repeated mentions of improving code review turnaround time, but little evidence of consistent tracking or measurable outcomes.

Overall, retrospectives at Focus Bear are well-documented, with clear sections outlining what went well, what didn’t, and suggestions for improvement. However, follow-up on action items could be more structured and visible. Adding a section to each retrospective specifically reviewing the status of past actions, with assigned owners and deadlines, would make the feedback loop more effective and reinforce a culture of continuous improvement.

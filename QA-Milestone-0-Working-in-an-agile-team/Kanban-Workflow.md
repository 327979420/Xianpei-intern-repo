# Reflection  

## How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?  

Kanban uses multiple columns to organize Kanban cards, allowing team members to see the current stage of each user story. If a user story needs to be prioritized, it can be placed at the top of the list.  Since Kanban is a pull system, if the high-priority column is nearly empty, it signals the team to pull the next story from the backlog into the active development stage. Additionally, Kanban sets a work in progress (WIP) limit, restricting the number of tasks or team members working on a task simultaneously. This helps prevent overload, ensuring that teams focus on completing existing work before starting new tasks.  

## How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?  

By setting WIP limits, I can avoid overloading myself with too many test cases at once, ensuring that I complete and verify each task properly. I can move critical defects to the top of the queue for faster resolution, prioritizing urgent bugs to improve software quality efficiently.

# Task  

## Identify one way you can improve task tracking in your role.  

I can actively add comments on each task with test results, screenshots, and reproduction steps. This improves visibility for developers and ensures clear communication about identified issues.

## How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?  

Agile ceremonies foster better collaboration and keep the team aligned by providing a **structured series of meetings** during a sprint. These ceremonies ensure **effective communication, alignment, and continuous improvement**.  

For example:  
- **Stand-ups** are short, routine meetings where team members provide quick updates, helping everyone stay informed and identify potential blockers.  
- **Sprint planning** ensures that every team member understands their goals and priorities before the sprint begins, promoting alignment and a shared vision.  

## Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?

## Document One Change You Can Make to Improve Team Collaboration  

To further enhance team collaboration, one challenge we are currently facing as of **February 26, 2025**, is **GitHub access issues and delays reported by onboarding interns**.  

To address this, I can:  
- Compile **a set of FAQs** for the onboarding process.  
- Identify and correct typos in the onboarding instructions.  
- Serve as a **GitHub buddy** to support new interns, reducing the workload on supervisors by minimizing repetitive onboarding explanations.  

These improvements will help streamline the onboarding process and make it easier for new team members to integrate smoothly.

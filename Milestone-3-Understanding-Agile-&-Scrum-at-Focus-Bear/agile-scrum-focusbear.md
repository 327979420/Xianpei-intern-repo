# 🏆 Milestone: Understanding Agile & Scrum at Focus Bear

## 🔄 Introduction to Agile & Scrum

### 🔍 Research & Learn

#### ❓What are the Agile Manifesto principles, and how do they influence software development?
  The Agile Manifesto consists of four values and twelve principles that prioritize customer collaboration, adaptability, and working software over rigid processes. It helps teams develop software faster by encouraging small, frequent updates and continuous feedback. This way, projects can adapt easily to new requirements and deliver better results.

#### ❓What is Scrum, and how does it structure work in Agile teams?
  Scrum is a lightweight Agile framework used for developing products through iterative and incremental progress. It structures work by organizing tasks into time-boxed iterations called sprints (typically 1–4 weeks), where teams plan, develop, review, and improve their work. 

Scrum teams consist of:
- **Product Owner** – manages requirements and prioritizes backlog.
- **Scrum Master** – ensures smooth processes and removes roadblocks.
- **Development Team** – cross-functional members who build the product.

Key Scrum ceremonies include sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives.

#### ❓What are Scrum ceremonies (Sprint Planning, Standups, Sprint Review, Retrospective)?
- **Sprint Planning** – The team decides what to work on in the next sprint.
- **Daily Standups** – A short meeting every day to check progress and discuss any problems.
- **Sprint Review** – The team showcases completed work and gathers feedback.
- **Sprint Retrospective** – The team reflects on what went well and identifies areas for improvement.

## 📝 Reflection

#### ❓What are the biggest benefits of Agile & Scrum for software teams?

Agile and Scrum help software teams collaborate better and adapt quickly to changes. At Focus Bear, we follow this approach using weekly sprints and daily standups, which keep everyone aligned and make it easier to deliver value consistently.

Instead of waiting months for a finished product, the Focus Bear team releases updates frequently—guided by ongoing feedback from users and internal testing. Using GitHub Projects, we manage sprint tasks in bite-sized chunks, allowing us to build, test, and iterate faster. However, Notion and other shared documents are always options to track internal documentation, retrospective notes, and sometimes to visualize broader roadmaps or onboarding progress. This dual-system setup could help with both detailed tracking and high-level planning.

#### ❓How does Scrum help teams stay adaptable and improve continuously?
Scrum rituals like retrospectives and sprint planning allow us to make constant improvements. At Focus Bear, retros are held every Friday once they start. 

One takeaway from a recent retro was the need to clarify onboarding tasks across teams. In response, I helped document clearer workflows and reviewed how task assignment works in GitHub Projects.

Personally, I’ve also used retros to improve my task scoping and time estimation, so that issues get done within sprint boundaries. For example, I started setting internal deadlines mid-sprint to avoid having to rush at the end.

#### ❓What challenges do teams face when implementing Agile, and how can they overcome them?
One challenge is working with rotating interns from different time zones, which can cause delays or misalignment. At Focus Bear, we’ve overcome this by:

- Holding regular daily standups (via Google Meet)
- Using Discord and GitHub issues for asynchronous updates
- Assigning a clear PM contact for each project
- Sharing user manual and team contact 

When issues arise—like unclear task requirements or missed standups—I’ve learned to proactively reach out, update the sprint board, or clarify in meetings. This ensures the team stays focused and can still meet sprint goals even when unexpected blockers come up.

🏆 Milestone: Stakeholder Management & Communication

🤝 Facilitating Communication Between Developers, QAs, and PMs

🔍 Research & Learn

What are common miscommunication issues between Developers, QAs, and PMs?
Common issues include unclear requirements, lack of shared understanding of acceptance criteria, and mismatched expectations on timelines or priorities. Developers might build features differently than PMs intended, or QAs might receive features too late for thorough testing. These gaps often stem from not involving all roles early in planning or not updating each other on changes during the sprint.

How do Agile teams balance feature development, bug fixes, and testing in each sprint?
Agile teams allocate sprint capacity across features, bug fixes, and testing based on team velocity and priority. High-impact bugs and testing tasks are treated as first-class citizens in the sprint backlog, planned alongside new feature work. Continuous integration and early QA involvement help ensure that testing happens in parallel with development, reducing last-minute pressure.

What techniques can Scrum Masters use to resolve conflicts between teams?
Scrum Masters use active listening, one-on-one conversations, and neutral facilitation to understand each side’s perspective. They guide the team in finding common ground by focusing on shared goals, like delivering value and improving the workflow. Tools like retrospectives, conflict resolution workshops, or decision matrices can also be used to resolve disputes constructively.

How should information flow between developers, testers, and product managers to avoid bottlenecks?
Information should flow continuously through daily standups, shared task boards, and direct communication in channels like Slack or GitHub comments. PMs should clearly define requirements and priorities, developers should share progress and blockers early, and QAs should be looped in as features are built—not just after. Using centralized tools with clear status updates helps ensure everyone stays aligned and informed.

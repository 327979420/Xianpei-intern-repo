# Agile Methodology: Benefits, Challenges, and Impact on My Role  

---

## 1. What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?  

The biggest benefits of Agile include fast response times and strong communication within internal teams. Customers do not have to wait long after submitting feedback, as the software team can quickly adapt to requirement changes. These characteristics greatly enhance the *ser experience and satisfaction.  

However, since Agile emphasizes quick iterations and continuous adjustments**, documentation during the process tends to be weaker. For example, in a fast-paced Agile environment, test plans or design documents may not always be fully detailed, making it difficult for new team members to understand past decisions or changes in requirements. This can create challenges when revisiting previous work or onboarding new team members.

## 2. How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?  

Agile principles encourage me to **continuously update and plan my work** to stay aligned with the team on a daily basis. I ensure at least one face-to-face working session each week to communicate effectively with teammates. Additionally, I prioritize simplicity and efficiency, allowing me to complete testing tasks efficiently and contribute to delivering functional software. Most importantly, I **stay open to change**, adapting quickly to new priorities and ensuring a smooth testing process.

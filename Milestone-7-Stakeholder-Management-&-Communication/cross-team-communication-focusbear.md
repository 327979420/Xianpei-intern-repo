# 🏆 Milestone: Stakeholder Management & Communication

## 🤝 Facilitating Communication Between Developers, QAs, and PMs

## 🔍 Research & Learn

### ❓ What are common miscommunication issues between Developers, QAs, and PMs?  
Common issues include unclear requirements, lack of shared understanding of acceptance criteria, and mismatched expectations on timelines or priorities. Developers might build features differently than PMs intended, or QAs might receive features too late for thorough testing. These gaps often stem from not involving all roles early in planning or not updating each other on changes during the sprint.

### ❓ How do Agile teams balance feature development, bug fixes, and testing in each sprint?  
High-impact bugs and testing tasks are treated as first-class citizens in the sprint backlog, planned alongside new feature work. Continuous integration and early QA involvement help ensure that testing happens in parallel with development, reducing last-minute pressure.

### ❓ What techniques can Scrum Masters use to resolve conflicts between teams?  
Scrum Masters use active listening, one-on-one conversations, and neutral facilitation to understand each side’s perspective. They guide the team in finding common ground by focusing on shared goals, like delivering value and improving the workflow. Tools like retrospectives, conflict resolution workshops, or decision matrices can also be used to resolve disputes constructively.

### ❓ How should information flow between developers, testers, and product managers to avoid bottlenecks?  
Information should flow continuously through daily standups, shared task boards, and direct communication in channels like Discord or GitHub comments. PMs should clearly define requirements and priorities, developers should share progress and blockers early, and QAs should be looped in as features are built—not just after. Using centralized tools with clear status updates helps ensure everyone stays aligned and informed.

## 📝 Reflection

### ❓ If Developers and QAs disagree on the severity of a bug, how should a Scrum Master handle it?  
The Scrum Master should act as a neutral facilitator to guide the conversation toward clarity and resolution.

First, they can bring both parties together—ideally during a standup or a quick sync—to clarify the impact of the bug on users and whether it affects sprint goals or release readiness. For example, if a QA flags a bug as critical but the developer sees it as minor, the Scrum Master can prompt questions like, “Does this block a core workflow?” or “Can this be safely deferred to the next sprint?”

If needed, they may also involve the PM to assess business impact. By focusing the discussion on user impact, agreed-upon severity criteria, and team priorities, the Scrum Master helps avoid personal friction and ensures an informed, balanced decision is made.

### ❓ How can PMs and Developers align feature priorities without overloading the sprint?  
PMs should first share the business goals for the sprint and collaborate with developers to break down features into smaller, clearly scoped tasks in GitHub Projects. Developers can then assess the effort involved based on their availability—especially important in a team with part-time interns—helping set realistic limits on what can be delivered.

The team can also categorize tasks by priority in GitHub Projects (Low, Higher, Extralia) to ensure critical work is completed first, while lower-priority items can be deferred if time runs short.

Regular check-ins during the sprint help maintain alignment and allow for early adjustments if the workload becomes unmanageable.

### ❓ What are the risks of not involving QAs early in the development process?  
Without early QA input, test cases and edge scenarios may be overlooked, resulting in bugs that are only discovered late in the sprint—when there's little time left to fix them. This often leads to last-minute rushes, increasing stress and the chance of releasing unstable features.

It also creates communication gaps, where QAs might not fully understand the feature’s context or intended behavior, making testing less effective.

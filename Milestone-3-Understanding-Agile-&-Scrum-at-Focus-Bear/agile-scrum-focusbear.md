# 🏆 Milestone: Understanding Agile & Scrum at Focus Bear

## 🔄 Introduction to Agile & Scrum

### 🔍 Research & Learn

#### ❓What are the Agile Manifesto principles, and how do they influence software development?
The Agile Manifesto consists of four values and twelve principles that prioritize customer collaboration, adaptability, and working software over rigid processes. It helps teams develop software faster by encouraging small, frequent updates and continuous feedback. This way, projects can adapt easily to new requirements and deliver better results.

#### ❓What is Scrum, and how does it structure work in Agile teams?
Scrum is a lightweight Agile framework used for developing products through iterative and incremental progress. It structures work by organizing tasks into time-boxed iterations called sprints (typically 1–4 weeks), where teams plan, develop, review, and improve their work. 

Scrum teams consist of:
- **Product Owner** – manages requirements and prioritizes backlog.
- **Scrum Master** – ensures smooth processes and removes roadblocks.
- **Development Team** – cross-functional members who build the product.

Key Scrum ceremonies include sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives.

#### ❓What are Scrum ceremonies (Sprint Planning, Standups, Sprint Review, Retrospective)?
- **Sprint Planning** – The team decides what to work on in the next sprint.
- **Daily Standups** – A short meeting every day to check progress and discuss any problems.
- **Sprint Review** – The team showcases completed work and gathers feedback.
- **Sprint Retrospective** – The team reflects on what went well and identifies areas for improvement.

## 📝 Reflection

#### ❓What are the biggest benefits of Agile & Scrum for software teams?
Agile and Scrum help software teams collaborate better and adapt quickly to changes. Work is done in small steps, allowing teams to release updates quickly instead of waiting months. 

For example, a software team can launch a basic version of a product and keep improving it based on user feedback. Scrum also keeps everyone aligned with daily check-ins and regular feedback loops, reducing wasted effort.

#### ❓How does Scrum help teams stay adaptable and improve continuously?
Scrum uses short sprints and regular feedback to help teams adjust quickly. If a customer requests a new feature, the team can add it to the backlog and include it in the next sprint. 

After every sprint:
- **Sprint Review** ensures the product meets expectations.
- **Retrospective** helps teams identify improvements and refine their workflow.

#### ❓What challenges do teams face when implementing Agile, and how can they overcome them?
Teams often struggle with unclear requirements and poor communication. To address this:
- Keep user stories simple and well-defined.
- Hold regular discussions with stakeholders.
- Refine the backlog to clarify priorities.

For example, if a team is confused about what to focus on, the Product Manager can refine the backlog and clarify goals. Strong collaboration and adapting to feedback are key to Agile success.

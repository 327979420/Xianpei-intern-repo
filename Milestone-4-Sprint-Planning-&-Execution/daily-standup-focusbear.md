# 🎙️ Facilitating Daily Standups

## 🔍 Research & Learn

### ❓ What is the purpose of a daily standup, and how does it fit into Scrum?  
The purpose of a daily standup is to provide the Scrum team with a short, focused opportunity to synchronize progress, share updates, and identify blockers that might impact the sprint. In Scrum, this event is called the **Daily Scrum**, timeboxed to 15 minutes to ensure efficiency.  
It keeps the team aligned with the sprint goal, encourages daily communication, and promotes transparency. At Focus Bear, the backend team uses daily standups to review task status in GitHub Projects and quickly clarify any issues.

### ❓ What are the three key questions team members answer during standups?  
1. What did you work on yesterday (or your last working day)?  
2. What will you work on today?  
3. Are there any blockers or impediments?  

### ❓ How can Scrum Masters keep standups short and productive?  
Scrum Masters should encourage concise updates and discourage problem-solving during the standup itself. Any in-depth discussions should be deferred to separate meetings.  
Using a visible task board, like GitHub Projects, helps structure conversations and keep everyone on track. It’s important to start on time and maintain a consistent format, which builds habits of punctuality and efficiency.

### ❓ What are common pitfalls in standups, and how can they be avoided?  

🛠️ **Turning standups into problem-solving sessions**  
- *Problem:* Discussions become detailed, causing meetings to run long.  
- *Solution:* The Scrum Master should acknowledge the topic and suggest a follow-up discussion after the standup.

🗣️ **Team members reporting only to the Scrum Master**  
- *Problem:* Updates feel like status reports rather than team collaboration.  
- *Solution:* Encourage communication between team members, reinforcing shared ownership.

🔁 **Repetitive or disengaged updates**  
- *Problem:* Team members share the same information daily, without mentioning blockers or progress.  
- *Solution:* Ask team members to focus on changes since the last meeting and raise any blockers.

⏰ **Inconsistent attendance or preparation**  
- *Problem:* Some members miss standups or come unprepared.  
- *Solution:* Maintain a consistent schedule and ask team members to update the board before the meeting to streamline discussions.

## 📝 Reflection

### ❓ What challenges can arise during standups, and how should a Scrum Master handle them?  

**Off-topic discussions**  
In our standup on 03/17, a team member asked about the agenda for a separate engineering meeting. Since I wasn’t attending that meeting, I politely acknowledged the question but redirected focus to the standup. I encouraged them to follow up after the meeting and let me know if they needed me to escalate anything.  
As a Scrum Master, it’s important to respectfully acknowledge unrelated topics and then steer the conversation back to the standup’s purpose: sharing updates, plans, and blockers.

**Lack of preparation**  
Occasionally, team members join standups without updating their tasks in GitHub Projects. For example, in one recent meeting, a developer gave a brief 10-second update with little clarity on their progress.  
To address this, I plan to send reminders before each standup, outlining the agenda and key questions (What did you do yesterday? What will you do today? Any blockers?). This will encourage better preparation and clearer communication.

### ❓ If a standup turns into a long discussion, how can the Scrum Master bring it back on track?  
At Focus Bear, if a standup begins turning into a deep discussion, the Scrum Master should politely interrupt and suggest parking the topic for later. For instance, during an earlier standup, a developer raised a GitHub issue about strict blocking mode, which led to an extended conversation. Jeremy, our team lead, handled this by acknowledging its importance but ending the standup on time. He then left the meeting room open for those who wanted to continue the discussion.  
As Scrum Master, I now use a similar approach:  
- Acknowledge the topic and its relevance.  
- Suggest taking it offline for a follow-up discussion.  
- Refocus the group on the standup agenda.  
This keeps standups brief, ensures team engagement, and respects everyone’s time.

### ❓ How can standups be improved when working with remote or distributed teams?  

🕒 **Be strict about scheduling and time zones**  
We maintain a consistent standup time that works for most team members across time zones. For those unable to join live, we use a shared Google Doc where they can post asynchronous updates, and meeting notes are captured using Fathom AI.

📋 **Use a clear agenda and structured questions**  
Before each standup, I send a quick reminder with the three key questions. This helps remote team members prepare, particularly those working asynchronously.

🎥 **Encourage camera use (when possible)**  
When network conditions allow, we encourage cameras on during standups to foster connection and engagement. I always keep my camera on to set the tone, but there’s no pressure for others if conditions aren’t ideal.

💡 **Leave time for follow-ups**  
After the standup, we leave a few minutes open for anyone who wants to clarify tasks or discuss blockers. This mirrors Jeremy’s approach of keeping the room open post-standup for deeper conversations.

These practices help keep our remote standups at Focus Bear inclusive, efficient, and collaborative.

## 🛠️ Task

### ❓ Identify any challenges or areas for improvement in the standup process.  

One ongoing challenge is **inconsistent attendance** due to varying schedules, particularly in a remote work setting.  
➡️ **Consequence:** Gaps in communication and reduced visibility into team progress.

✅ **Improvement Actions:**  
- Continue promoting asynchronous updates in the shared Google Doc for those unable to join live.  
- Explore rotating standup times or offering additional catch-up sessions for those frequently unavailable.  
- Update our onboarding guide to clarify expectations around standup participation and communication in a remote environment.

### ❓ Write a short reflection on how Daily Standups are conducted at Focus Bear.  

At Focus Bear, Daily Standups are key to keeping the team aligned, particularly since most team members work remotely and have different schedules.  
In previous terms, up to 20 interns joined a combined standup led by an Agile Project Manager. These were held daily for 10 to 15 minutes, with Jeremy stepping in as host whenever the PM was away. A one-hour Retrospective and Weekly Planning meeting was held every Wednesday, bringing both remote and on-site team members together.

Currently, I facilitate backend team standups three times per week—Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays—from 11:30 AM to 11:45 AM. This schedule accommodates most team members’ working days. Calendar invites are sent in advance, and a shared Google Doc allows asynchronous updates for those unable to attend live.  
During each standup, I use Fathom AI to automatically capture notes and track attendance. Afterward, I update our shared doc with attendance and meeting summaries so the entire team remains informed and prepared for the next session.

This system helps ensure consistent communication, promotes accountability, and fosters collaboration across our distributed team.

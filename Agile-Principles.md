# Agile Methodology: Benefits, Challenges, and Impact on My Role  

---

## 1. What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?  

The biggest benefits of Agile include fast response times and strong communication within internal teams. Customers do not have to wait long after submitting feedback, as the software team can quickly adapt to requirement changes. These characteristics greatly enhance the user experience and satisfaction.  

However, since Agile emphasizes quick iterations and continuous adjustments, documentation during the process tends to be weaker. For example, in a fast-paced Agile environment, test plans or design documents may not always be fully detailed, making it difficult for new team members to understand past decisions or changes in requirements. This can create challenges when revisiting previous work or onboarding new team members.

## 2. How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?  

Agile principles encourage me to **continuously update and plan my work** to stay aligned with the team on a daily basis. I ensure at least one face-to-face working session each week to communicate effectively with teammates. Additionally, I prioritize simplicity and efficiency, allowing me to complete testing tasks efficiently and contribute to delivering functional software. Most importantly, I **stay open to change**, adapting quickly to new priorities and ensuring a smooth testing process.

## Task 1: Summarize the Main Differences Between Scrum and Kanban  

Scrum follows a **structured sprint-based approach**, where work is planned in fixed iterations (sprints), and only **limited changes** can be made within each sprint. Each team member has a **defined role**, and the process follows a structured framework with sprint planning, reviews, and retrospectives.  

Kanban, on the other hand, is **more flexible and allows continuous work management**. It does not follow fixed-length iterations, making it **more adaptable to change**. Work is visualized on a Kanban board, and tasks move through the workflow based on priority and capacity rather than predefined sprints.

## Task 2: Identify One Agile Principle That Will Be Most Useful in Your Work  

**Customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery.**  

I will prioritize **user feedback** and incorporate it into testing to ensure the software meets users' needs. By continuously refining and improving based on real feedback, I can contribute to a more user-centric development process.

## 📊 Tracking Standup Attendance in Google Sheets

## 🔍 Research & Learn

### ❓ Why is it important for Scrum teams to have regular attendance at standups?  
Regular attendance ensures transparency, fosters team alignment, and helps identify blockers early. According to the Scrum Guide (2020), the Daily Scrum is a key event for inspecting progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapting the plan to optimize collaboration and performance. Consistent participation encourages accountability and keeps everyone informed about team priorities and challenges.

### ❓ How does Focus Bear track attendance using Google Sheets?  
At Focus Bear, Project Managers manually record team members' attendance, or a designated scribe marks it in a shared spreadsheet. This simple system helps keep a clear record of participation without adding extra complexity to the standup process.

### ❓ How can Scrum Masters use attendance data to identify potential team issues?  
Frequent absences, late arrivals, or inconsistent participation can signal deeper issues such as disengagement, workload imbalance, or personal challenges. According to Lyssa Adkins' *Coaching Agile Teams*, tracking attendance allows Scrum Masters to spot early warning signs of low morale, communication breakdowns, or team dysfunction. For example, if a team member frequently misses standups, it may indicate they are overwhelmed or feeling disconnected. By recognizing these signs early, the Scrum Master can initiate a one-on-one conversation to offer support or adjust team dynamics as needed.

### ❓ What actions should be taken if a team member regularly misses standups?  
If a team member regularly misses standups, the Scrum Master should begin with a private, supportive conversation to understand the cause. If the issue is task overload, the Scrum Master can help rebalance workloads or clarify priorities. If the problem is due to scheduling conflicts, adjusting the standup time may help. If absences continue, the Scrum Master can encourage the team member to provide asynchronous updates or pair them with a teammate for better communication. As a last resort, if the situation negatively impacts team performance, the Scrum Master may escalate the concern to management.

## 📝 Reflection

### ❓ How can tracking attendance help improve communication and team engagement?  
Tracking attendance helps foster consistent participation, reinforcing accountability and making team members feel included. Regular standup participation strengthens team bonds and reduces isolation, promoting more open communication. When everyone shows up and actively engages, it creates an environment where people feel safe to share ideas, raise concerns, and collaborate more effectively.

### ❓ What are the potential reasons someone might skip standups, and how should a Scrum Master address them?  
Potential reasons for missing standups include feeling overwhelmed with tasks, unclear role expectations, lack of engagement, scheduling conflicts, or personal challenges. The Scrum Master should address these situations with empathy through a private conversation to understand the root cause. Depending on the issue, they can adjust workloads, clarify responsibilities, change the standup time, or offer additional support. The goal is to re-engage the team member and ensure they feel valued and included in the team.

### ❓ How can standups be more engaging to encourage participation?  
Varying the format and content of standups can make them more engaging and prevent them from becoming repetitive. For example, rather than always asking the standard three questions, Scrum Masters can focus on different themes like “What’s your top priority today?” or “Is there anything blocking you?” Occasionally switching to walk-and-talk standups or incorporating visuals like burndown charts or velocity charts can keep things fresh. These variations help maintain interest and encourage more meaningful participation.

## 🛠️ Task

### ❓ Write a short reflection on how standup attendance tracking is used at Focus Bear.  
Standup attendance tracking at Focus Bear was initially handled through Notion, where Cinmily used built-in checkboxes to record attendance during daily standups. While I don’t currently have direct access to this file, I’ve learned that it’s updated live and provides a quick visual reference for who attended each session. In addition, Google Calendar invites are used to cross-reference attendance history when needed.

From daily stand-ups, it appears that attendance isn’t formally reviewed on a fixed schedule, but patterns have emerged—particularly among interns with part-time availability. For example, backend interns who only work on Mondays and Tuesdays often miss mid- or late-week standups, potentially leading to misalignment during sprints. In another team, some members have repeatedly missed standups and even sprint planning sessions, without prior communication, which raises concerns around team coordination and accountability.

To prevent this, I created a dedicated Google Sheet tracker, updated weekly, to monitor attendance across the teams. This helps surface attendance gaps early, allowing for timely follow-up. Likewise, I have created a attendance sheet for tracking in-peron session. As we have more participant in both daily stand-up and coworking session, I believe the team will be more aligned, boosting an environment for cooperation. 

If a team member consistently misses meetings without notice, I plan to schedule a one-on-one check-in to understand the reason—whether it’s due to time conflicts, personal challenges, or disengagement. If it’s a scheduling issue, I will encourage the member to submit async updates before standups to keep the team aligned without requiring rescheduling. This structured approach aims to improve consistency, strengthen communication, and ensure everyone stays engaged in the sprint workflow.

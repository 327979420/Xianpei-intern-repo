# Cyber Security

1. **Security Measures:**  
   I store my passwords securely using a password manager. For sensitive accounts such as e-wallets and banking services, I use multi-factor authentication (almost all app require this) to add an extra layer of protection. I regularly review and update my security settings, avoid storing credentials in unsecured locations, and always turn off my devices when not in use to minimize unauthorized access risks.  

2. **Secure Behavior Habits:**  
   I avoid clicking on unknown links, use two-factor authentication whenever possible, and regularly update my software to protect against vulnerabilities.  

3. **Passwords and Account Management:**  
   I routinely update my passwords and ensure they meet security standards by including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. I rely on a trusted password manager to store my credentials securely and prevent exposure. Additionally, I use unique passwords for every critical account and enable security alerts to receive immediate notifications of suspicious login attempts or unauthorized access.  

4. **Handling Security Breaches:**  
   In the event of a security breach, I would immediately disconnect my device from the internet, close all sensitive programs, and secure critical accounts by resetting passwords. I would run an in-depth malware scan using trusted security software and check for any signs of unauthorized access. If necessary, I would report the incident to my IT department or service provider and follow appropriate protocols to mitigate further risks.

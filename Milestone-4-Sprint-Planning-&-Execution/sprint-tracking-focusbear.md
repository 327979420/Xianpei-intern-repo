# 🏆 Milestone: Sprint Planning & Execution

## 📊 Tracking Sprint Progress & Managing Scope Changes

## 🔍 Research & Learn

### ❓ What are the best ways to track sprint progress (burndown charts, task boards, velocity tracking)?
📅 **Daily Standups**  
These quick, regular check-ins help the team stay aligned and provide real-time updates on progress.  
Standups also give the Scrum Master an opportunity to identify potential issues early and ensure tasks are moving forward.

📉 **Burndown Charts**  
Burndown charts show the amount of work remaining versus time, helping teams quickly see if they’re on track to complete their sprint goals.  
They make it easy to spot scope creep or delays early.

📋 **Task Boards**  
Physical or digital boards visually display the status of each task—typically in columns like **To Do**, **In Progress**, and **Done**.  
They give the team and stakeholders a real-time view of progress.

🚀 **Velocity Tracking**  
Velocity measures how much work a team completes in each sprint.  
It helps with future sprint planning by giving a sense of how much the team can realistically deliver.

### ❓ How do Scrum teams handle scope changes during a sprint?
Scrum teams handle scope changes carefully to protect the sprint goal and maintain focus.  
According to Scrum principles, once a sprint has started, its scope should remain stable to avoid disrupting the team's flow and commitments.

However, if a change is critical, the Product Owner can collaborate with the team to decide whether to add or remove work.  
In some cases, the Product Owner may cancel the sprint if the sprint goal becomes obsolete due to major changes.  
Otherwise, new requests are typically added to the product backlog and prioritized for future sprints.

### ❓ What techniques help identify and address risks or bottlenecks early?
📋 **Task Boards and Cumulative Flow Diagrams (CFDs)**  
These visual tools help spot tasks stuck **In Progress** or identify stages with buildup, signaling potential bottlenecks in the workflow.

🔄 **Retrospectives**  
Regular reflection sessions allow teams to identify recurring issues or risks from previous sprints, enabling proactive changes.

📝 **Risk Registers or RAID Logs**  
Some teams maintain simple logs to track **Risks**, **Assumptions**, **Issues**, and **Dependencies**, helping them stay aware of potential threats and manage them effectively.

### ❓ What role does the Scrum Master play in protecting the team’s focus and productivity?
The Scrum Master enforces Scrum practices and ensures the team isn’t overloaded with unplanned work or interrupted by scope changes.  

They foster a healthy team environment by facilitating open communication, resolving conflicts, and encouraging collaboration.  
Additionally, they promote an efficient workflow by encouraging good practices, such as updating task boards and holding effective standups.  

Ultimately, the Scrum Master supports the team so they can stay focused on delivering valuable work each sprint.

## 📝 Reflection

### ❓ If the team realizes mid-sprint that they won’t finish all tasks, how should the Scrum Master respond?
The Scrum Master should first facilitate an open discussion to understand why the team is falling behind.  
For example, they might review the task board to identify bottlenecks—such as too many tasks stuck in the **In Progress** column—or blockers slowing things down.

Next, they should help the team re-focus on the sprint goal by prioritizing the most valuable tasks that can still be completed.  
The Scrum Master can work with the Product Owner to decide if lower-priority tasks should be moved back to the product backlog for a future sprint.

### ❓ How can scope changes be assessed and communicated without disrupting sprint goals?

First, the Product Owner evaluates whether the change is critical and if it directly impacts the value being delivered.  
If necessary, the Scrum Master facilitates a conversation with the team to assess the impact on workload and commitments.

Clear communication is key—any scope adjustment should be discussed during standups or a dedicated meeting, so everyone understands the priority shift without disrupting focus.  
If the change can wait, it’s added to the product backlog for future sprints, keeping the current sprint stable and on track.

### ❓ What are the risks of micromanaging sprint tracking, and how can they be avoided?

⚠️ **Risk:** Reduced team ownership and motivation  
- *Micromanaging can make team members feel they’re not trusted, leading to lower engagement and initiative.*  
✅ **How to avoid:** Empower the team to self-manage their tasks and updates. Encourage regular standups and foster a culture of accountability rather than control.

⚠️ **Risk:** Disrupting team focus and flow  
- *Constant check-ins and status requests can interrupt the team’s concentration and reduce productivity.*  
✅ **How to avoid:** Use visual tools like task boards or dashboards that provide transparency without constant questioning. Trust the team’s process and let updates happen during planned ceremonies.

⚠️ **Risk:** Slowing down decision-making and innovation  
- *Micromanagement often leads to decision bottlenecks, where team members wait for approval instead of acting.*  
✅ **How to avoid:** Clarify roles and responsibilities so team members feel confident making decisions within their scope.

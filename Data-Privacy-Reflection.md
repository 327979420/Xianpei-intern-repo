# Data Security Best Practices

## 1. What steps can you take to ensure you handle data securely in your daily tasks?  
Always use strong passwords and enable MFA for extra security. Avoid using public Wi-Fi for work-related tasks, and keep software updated to fix security issues. Additionally, be mindful of phishing email attempts and verify sources before clicking on links or downloading attachments.  

## 2. How should you store, share, and dispose of sensitive information safely?  
Store sensitive data in encrypted folders or secure cloud storage with limited access. When sharing data, use encrypted emails or secure file-sharing tools instead of public platforms. 

## 3. What are some common mistakes that lead to data privacy issues, and how can they be avoided?  
This include using weak passwords, accidentally sending data to the wrong person, or leaving sensitive information visible on the screen. To prevent these, I would use a password manager to generate and store strong passwords like what was suggested on the onboarding day, double-check recipients before sending sensitive data, and always lock my screen when stepping away.

# ✅Focus Bear: Feedback and Suggestions

### 1. **What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?**  
   Focus Bear includes instructional/tutorial videos to help users get accustomed to the app. It is also the only app that uses pop-ups to ask for feedback and encourage mindfulness or yoga sessions. However, these features should be used cautiously, as frequent prompts may induce stress or create negative opinions toward the app. Additionally, the iOS version of Focus Bear is not as developed as its competitors, with some key features missing (e.g., no recurring sessions or the ability to schedule future sessions), while other competing products are more mature.

### 2. **If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?**  
   I like the simplicity of Focus Bear on iOS. Many users may be drawn to its core function and appreciate a straightforward "click-and-go" experience. However, some competing apps with extra features—such as social media sharing (Tiimo) or a collection of focus sounds (Freedom)—might inadvertently lead to distractions.

### 3. **What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?**  
   - Support for future and recurring sessions  
   - Integration with calendar apps for better scheduling  

### 4. **what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?**  
   Inspired by Tiimo, which has the largest user base, I believe Focus Bear should incorporate a to-do list and activity history. Syncing with the local calendar would allow users to follow their daily, weekly, and monthly plans more effectively. Additionally, reviewing completed tasks could provide users with a stronger sense of achievement, encouraging long-term engagement with the app.

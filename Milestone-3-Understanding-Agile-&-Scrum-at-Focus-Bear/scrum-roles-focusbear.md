# 🏆 Milestone: Understanding Agile & Scrum at Focus Bear

## 🏅 Scrum Roles & Product Management at Focus Bear

### 🔍 Research & Learn

❓ What are the key roles in Scrum, and how does Focus Bear’s team structure differ?  
Scrum has three main roles: **Product Manager** (sets priorities), **Scrum Master** (guides the team), and **Development Team** (builds the product).  

In contrast, Focus Bear’s team uses **Kanban**, which is more flexible with no fixed sprints. Instead of planning work in time-boxed cycles, tasks flow continuously, and priorities shift based on demand, making Kanban better for ongoing tasks rather than structured sprints.

❓ What is the role of a Product Manager in Agile, and how does it differ from a traditional Product Owner?  
A **Product Owner (PO)** focuses on the backlog, ensuring the team works on the right tasks in each sprint. A **Product Manager (PM)** looks at the bigger picture—market trends, business strategy, and long-term vision.  

In traditional Agile:
- The **PO** is team-focused, ensuring sprint priorities align with goals.  
- The **PM** works across multiple teams, aligning business objectives with product development.

❓ What responsibilities do Scrum Masters have in sprint planning, team facilitation, and continuous improvement?  
The **Scrum Master** helps with:
- **Sprint Planning** – Ensures realistic goals and clear priorities.  
- **Team Facilitation** – Removes roadblocks, fosters teamwork, and keeps meetings productive.  
- **Continuous Improvement** – Leads retrospectives to improve processes and efficiency.  

❓ What responsibilities do QA and UX designers have in an Agile environment?  
- **QA (Quality Assurance)** – Ensures software works correctly by testing early and often, catching bugs before users do. In the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**, QA typically conducts testing after the development phase.  
- **UX Designers** – Work closely with developers to create user-friendly designs, gathering feedback from users and refining designs based on sprint reviews.

## 📝 Reflection

❓ How do Scrum roles work together to ensure project success?  
Scrum roles collaborate to keep projects on track. Typically:
- The **PO** sets priorities.  
- The **Scrum Master** removes roadblocks.  
- The **Development Team** builds the product.  

If a customer requests a new feature:
1. The **PO** adds it to the backlog.  
2. The **Scrum Master** ensures the team has everything needed.  
3. Developers implement it in a sprint.  

Regular **Daily Standups** help keep everyone aligned and proactive in solving issues.

❓ How does a Product Manager's role impact sprint planning and backlog prioritization?  
The **PM** ensures the backlog aligns with business goals and customer needs. During **Sprint Planning**, they work with the **Product Owner** to prioritize features and bug fixes.  

❓ If a developer is struggling to complete a task, whose responsibility is it to help unblock them?  
- The **Scrum Master** helps remove obstacles.  
- Teammates can assist.  

For example, if a developer is stuck debugging a critical issue:
1. They discuss it in the **Daily Standup**.  
2. Another developer with experience in that area can help.  
3. If it's a requirement issue, the **Product Owner** clarifies what needs to be done.  

This ensures **smooth progress** and team collaboration.

# Inclusive-Design-Reflection

## 1. Communication style for neurodivergent users  
I would use a more inclusive style of language overall. If talking to my colleague, I will ask in a polite way and try not to be pushy. Additionally, I will provide clear, structured communication and allow extra processing time when necessary, ensuring that instructions or feedback are easy to understand.  

## 2. Pitfalls  
If communicating with neurodivergent users, I tend to use a less strong enforcing reminder like pop-up windows. Instead, I would use a message or notification to let them know so they may feel less stress and be less impulsive. Focus Bear now takes up to two steps to be turned off (exit button -> choose a reason why to turn off). I think this design may cause frustration or resistance, leading to a negative attitude toward the app and decreasing loyalty and retention. A better approach might be to provide a gentler reminder or an option to delay rather than forcing a justification.  

## 3. Practical changes  
I can advocate for clearer, more detailed instructions within my work, ensuring that information is accessible and easy to process for all coworkers.

❓ What are common challenges when running standups, sprint planning, and retrospectives?

## 📝 Reflection

❓ What techniques can help ensure standups remain short and focused?  
- **Set a strict time limit** (maximum **15 minutes**).  
- Follow the **three-question format**:
  1. What did you do yesterday?  
  2. What will you do today?  
  3. Are there any blockers?  

Keeping discussions structured prevents unnecessary conversations.

❓ How can you keep retrospectives productive while ensuring honest feedback?  
- Use **anonymous feedback tools** (e.g., **Miro, Retrium**) to encourage openness.  
- Ensure **action items** are **tracked and revisited** in the next retrospective.  
- Show that feedback leads to **real improvements**, increasing team trust.  

❓ If a developer or QA frequently misses standups, how should you handle it?  
1. **Check in privately** to understand the reason—time conflict? Lack of perceived value?  
2. **Set clear expectations** on participation.  
3. Suggest **async updates** if needed.  
4. **Escalate if necessary**, especially if it impacts collaboration.

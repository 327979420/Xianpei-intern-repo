# üèÜ Milestone: Understanding Agile & Scrum at Focus Bear

### ‚ùì What are the key roles in Scrum, and how does Focus Bear‚Äôs team structure differ?  
Scrum has three main roles: **Product Manager** (sets priorities), **Scrum Master** (guides the team), and **Development Team** (builds the product).  

In contrast, Focus Bear‚Äôs team uses **Kanban**, which is more flexible with no fixed sprints. Instead of planning work in time-boxed cycles, tasks flow continuously, and priorities shift based on demand, making Kanban better for ongoing tasks rather than structured sprints.

### ‚ùì What is the role of a Product Manager in Agile, and how does it differ from a traditional Product Owner?  
A **Product Owner (PO)** focuses on the backlog, ensuring the team works on the right tasks in each sprint. A **Product Manager (PM)** looks at the bigger picture‚Äîmarket trends, business strategy, and long-term vision.  

In traditional Agile:
- The **PO** is team-focused, ensuring sprint priorities align with goals.  
- The **PM** works across multiple teams, aligning business objectives with product development.

### ‚ùì What responsibilities do Scrum Masters have in sprint planning, team facilitation, and continuous improvement?  
The **Scrum Master** helps with:
- **Sprint Planning** ‚Äì Ensures realistic goals and clear priorities.  
- **Team Facilitation** ‚Äì Removes roadblocks, fosters teamwork, and keeps meetings productive.  
- **Continuous Improvement** ‚Äì Leads retrospectives to improve processes and efficiency.  

### ‚ùì What responsibilities do QA and UX designers have in an Agile environment?  
- **QA (Quality Assurance)** ‚Äì Ensures software works correctly by testing early and often, catching bugs before users do. In the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**, QA typically conducts testing after the development phase.  
- **UX Designers** ‚Äì Work closely with developers to create user-friendly designs, gathering feedback from users and refining designs based on sprint reviews.

## üìù Reflection

### ‚ùì How do Scrum roles work together to ensure project success?  
At Focus Bear, Scrum roles work collaboratively to keep our weekly sprints on track:

- The Product Manager (PM) prioritizes tasks based on business needs and user feedback.
- The Scrum Master (Project Manager Intern) facilitates meetings and helps remove roadblocks.
- The Development Team (Interns and Developers) implements the features and fixes.

For example, ideally, when a new onboarding feature was requested for incoming interns, the PM added it to the GitHub backlog, and it was discussed during sprint planning. The task was assigned to a developer intern, and the PM followed up during daily standups to check progress. When the intern faced confusion with UI styles, another teammate shared guidance, and the issue was unblocked quickly. These roles‚Äîand daily syncs‚Äîkeep the team aligned and ensure tasks are progressing even across time zones.

### ‚ùì How does a Product Manager's role impact sprint planning and backlog prioritization?  
At Focus Bear, the PM plays a central role in sprint planning and backlog grooming. They ensure the highest-priority tasks align with user needs‚Äîlike improving onboarding flow, squashing bugs, or refining features that support ADHD users.

For example, when preparing for the O-week app demo at Monash, the PM prioritized stability tasks and UI improvements in the sprint. During sprint planning, they walked the team through the updated GitHub board and made sure everyone understood the tasks and deadlines.

They also use Notion to outline roadmaps and cross-functional updates, helping interns understand how their tasks contribute to the larger product vision.

### ‚ùì If a developer is struggling to complete a task, whose responsibility is it to help unblock them?  
At Focus Bear, when a developer hits a roadblock, standups and Discord are used to raise the issue and find support. Typically:

 - The PM/Scrum Master facilitates unblocking by checking in and escalating if needed.
 - Peer interns or senior devs may step in to help troubleshoot.
 - If it‚Äôs a scope or clarity issue, the PM clarifies expectations and updates GitHub tickets accordingly.

For instance, in a recent retrospective, one intern was stuck estimating design time for UI work. After raising it in standup, the team reviewed the task in more detail and adjusted expectations. Another time, a developer struggled with React Native libraries and got help from another intern who‚Äôd already dealt with similar issues.

This kind of collaboration ensures tasks don't stay blocked and learning happens along the way.

# 🏆 Milestone: Sprint Planning & Execution

## 📅 How to Run Sprint Planning

## 🔍 Research & Learn

### ❓ What is the purpose of sprint planning, and when does it happen?

The purpose of sprint planning is to define what the Scrum team will deliver in the upcoming sprint and how they will accomplish that work.  
It sets a clear sprint goal, selects the highest-priority items from the product backlog, and breaks them into manageable tasks. Sprint planning ensures that everyone on the team understands the work and commits to a realistic amount they can complete.

Sprint planning happens at the start of each sprint, typically right after the previous sprint ends. It marks the beginning of the new sprint cycle and helps align the team on priorities and expectations.

### ❓ What are the key inputs needed for sprint planning (e.g., backlog, velocity, capacity)?

📝 **Product Backlog**  
A prioritized list of user stories, features, and tasks that are ready for selection. The Product Owner ensures these items are well-defined and clear.

📊 **Team Capacity**  
The team’s availability during the sprint, accounting for vacations, meetings, and other commitments. This helps set realistic expectations for how much work the team can take on.

🚀 **Velocity**  
The team’s historical data on how much work they typically complete in a sprint, often measured in story points. This helps guide how much work to pull into the sprint backlog.

🎯 **Sprint Goal**  
A clear objective that defines the focus and purpose of the sprint. It aligns the team on a common outcome beyond just completing tasks.

### ❓ How do teams estimate work using story points, t-shirt sizing, or time-based estimation?

🔢 **Story Points**  
Teams assign a relative number (e.g., 1, 3, 5, 8) to represent the complexity, effort, and risk of a task compared to others. They often use Planning Poker to vote and reach a consensus, focusing on relative effort rather than exact time.

👕 **T-Shirt Sizing**  
Tasks are categorized as XS, S, M, L, or XL, providing a high-level sense of effort and complexity without getting into specific numbers. It’s a quick way to compare tasks, especially useful in early planning stages.

⏱️ **Time-Based Estimation**  
Teams estimate how many hours or days a task will take. While more precise, this method can be tricky because it assumes a consistent work pace and often leads to over- or underestimation.

### ❓ How does a Scrum Master facilitate sprint planning to keep discussions focused and efficient?

A Scrum Master facilitates sprint planning by ensuring the team stays focused on defining a clear sprint goal and selecting the right amount of work to commit to.  
They start by helping the Product Owner present the prioritized backlog items that are ready for discussion.  

The Scrum Master then guides the team through estimating the effort required for each item, making sure conversations stay on track and don’t dive too deep into technical details that can be handled later.

To keep the meeting efficient, they manage time, encourage equal participation, and help the team align on their capacity and velocity before finalizing the sprint backlog. If debates or blockers arise, the Scrum Master may suggest parking those topics for follow-up discussions outside the planning session.

## 📝 Reflection

### ❓ How can teams balance ambition vs. realism when committing to sprint work?

One effective approach is starting sprint planning by reviewing the team’s current capacity. For example, if interns are working part-time or have different availability, we adjust commitments accordingly. We also rely on velocity data from previous sprints to set realistic expectations about how much work can be completed, rather than overcommitting based on enthusiasm.

During planning, we encourage open discussions about the complexity of tasks. For instance, if a new member is taking on something new like integrating Posthog APIs, we build in extra time for learning and support. By focusing on the Sprint Goal—such as improving onboarding flow or stabilizing the backend—we ensure the team is aligned on delivering valuable outcomes without spreading too thin. This balance helps maintain steady progress at Focus Bear while giving team members a chance to grow without feeling overwhelmed.

### ❓ If the team disagrees on an estimate, what techniques can help them reach alignment?

🃏 **Planning Poker**  
Each team member gives their estimate in story points anonymously (or simultaneously), which encourages honest input without influence.If the numbers vary widely, we have a focused discussion to understand why. For example, if someone estimates 2 points and another estimates 8, we explore their reasoning—maybe one person sees hidden complexity in API integration, while another doesn’t.

📏 **Relative Comparison**  
We compare the task to similar past tasks we’ve already completed. For example, if the team previously spent 3 days building a feature like the “cutoff time” functionality, we ask whether the current task, like adding a new event tracker, is simpler or more complex.

👕 **T-Shirt Sizing First**  
When estimates are far apart, we sometimes start with broad t-shirt sizing (S, M, L) to find general agreement, and then narrow it down to a specific point value. These techniques create a shared understanding and help members, especially interns at Focus Bear, feel comfortable sharing their perspectives.

### ❓ What are common mistakes in sprint planning, and how can they be avoided?

🥳 **Overcommitting without considering team capacity**  
Sometimes, the team gets excited about new features (like integrating new APIs or improving onboarding) and commits to too much work.  
We avoid this by reviewing team capacity upfront, factoring in each intern’s working hours and any external commitments, like university deadlines.

❌ **Unclear or poorly defined tasks**  
Tasks that aren’t clearly explained can cause confusion mid-sprint, leading to delays.  
We address this by ensuring every task in GitHub Projects includes a clear description, acceptance criteria, and, when possible, links to relevant documentation or designs.

🏃 **Skipping technical discussions during planning**  
Rushing through planning without considering technical complexities often leads to underestimation.  
To avoid this, we create space during sprint planning for developers to ask questions, especially interns who may need clarification on backend processes.

👀 **Ignoring previous sprint data**  
Not using past velocity or feedback can lead to unrealistic plans.  
At Focus Bear, we review previous sprints to help guide how much work the team can reasonably commit to in the next sprint.

## 🛠️ Task

### ❓ Identify any challenges or areas for improvement in the session.

### ❓ Write a short reflection on how Sprint Planning is done at Focus Bear.

After observing a Sprint Planning session at Focus Bear, I noticed that the team has a collaborative and open approach, with everyone contributing to task selection and estimation. We use GitHub Projects to organize tasks, and there’s a clear effort to review backlog items and prioritize based on the sprint goal, which helps maintain focus.

However, there are a few challenges and areas for improvement that stood out. One challenge is that estimations sometimes take longer than necessary, particularly when interns have different levels of understanding about the tasks. This occasionally leads to extended discussions that slow down planning.

To improve, we could introduce time-boxed discussions for estimates and use Planning Poker more consistently to streamline the process. Another area for improvement is the need for more upfront clarification on task requirements. For example, some tasks were discussed without full clarity on dependencies or expected outcomes, which led to back-and-forth conversations. Preparing clearer task descriptions in advance could make planning more efficient. Overall, Sprint Planning at Focus Bear is collaborative and team-driven, but adding more structure—like clearer task definitions and timeboxing discussions—could make it even more effective and time-efficient.

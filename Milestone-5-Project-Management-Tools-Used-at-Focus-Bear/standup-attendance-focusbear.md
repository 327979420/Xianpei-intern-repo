## 📊 Tracking Standup Attendance in Google Sheets

## 🔍 Research & Learn

### ❓ Why is it important for Scrum teams to have regular attendance at standups?  
Regular attendance ensures transparency, fosters team alignment, and helps identify blockers early. According to the Scrum Guide (2020), the Daily Scrum is a key event for inspecting progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapting the plan to optimize collaboration and performance. Consistent participation encourages accountability and keeps everyone informed about team priorities and challenges.

### ❓ How does Focus Bear track attendance using Google Sheets?  
At Focus Bear, Project Managers manually record team members' attendance, or a designated scribe marks it in a shared spreadsheet. This simple system helps keep a clear record of participation without adding extra complexity to the standup process.

### ❓ How can Scrum Masters use attendance data to identify potential team issues?  
Frequent absences, late arrivals, or inconsistent participation can signal deeper issues such as disengagement, workload imbalance, or personal challenges. According to Lyssa Adkins' *Coaching Agile Teams*, tracking attendance allows Scrum Masters to spot early warning signs of low morale, communication breakdowns, or team dysfunction. For example, if a team member frequently misses standups, it may indicate they are overwhelmed or feeling disconnected. By recognizing these signs early, the Scrum Master can initiate a one-on-one conversation to offer support or adjust team dynamics as needed.

### ❓ What actions should be taken if a team member regularly misses standups?  
If a team member regularly misses standups, the Scrum Master should begin with a private, supportive conversation to understand the cause. If the issue is task overload, the Scrum Master can help rebalance workloads or clarify priorities. If the problem is due to scheduling conflicts, adjusting the standup time may help. If absences continue, the Scrum Master can encourage the team member to provide asynchronous updates or pair them with a teammate for better communication. As a last resort, if the situation negatively impacts team performance, the Scrum Master may escalate the concern to management.

## 📝 Reflection

### ❓ How can tracking attendance help improve communication and team engagement?  
Tracking attendance helps foster consistent participation, reinforcing accountability and making team members feel included. Regular standup participation strengthens team bonds and reduces isolation, promoting more open communication. When everyone shows up and actively engages, it creates an environment where people feel safe to share ideas, raise concerns, and collaborate more effectively.

### ❓ What are the potential reasons someone might skip standups, and how should a Scrum Master address them?  
Potential reasons for missing standups include feeling overwhelmed with tasks, unclear role expectations, lack of engagement, scheduling conflicts, or personal challenges. The Scrum Master should address these situations with empathy through a private conversation to understand the root cause. Depending on the issue, they can adjust workloads, clarify responsibilities, change the standup time, or offer additional support. The goal is to re-engage the team member and ensure they feel valued and included in the team.

### ❓ How can standups be more engaging to encourage participation?  
Varying the format and content of standups can make them more engaging and prevent them from becoming repetitive. For example, rather than always asking the standard three questions, Scrum Masters can focus on different themes like “What’s your top priority today?” or “Is there anything blocking you?” Occasionally switching to walk-and-talk standups or incorporating visuals like burndown charts or velocity charts can keep things fresh. These variations help maintain interest and encourage more meaningful participation.

## 🛠️ Task

### ❓ Write a short reflection on how standup attendance tracking is used at Focus Bear.  
At Focus Bear, standup attendance tracking is managed through simple and accessible tools. Although I don’t have direct access to the current attendance file, I learned from a conversation with Cinmily that she uses Notion, utilizing built-in checkboxes to record each member’s attendance during standups. 

Additionally, the team can review past Google Calendar invites to cross-reference and confirm attendance for each session. Moving forward, I plan to create a Google Sheet to track attendance, as suggested. Since the backend team is relatively small, I can manually record meeting participation, even with members working on different days. This approach will help maintain consistency and support team engagement.
